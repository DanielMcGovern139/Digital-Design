# Verilog
Verilog is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems. This repository contains projects completed in a Digital systems Design module (3C7) in TCD.

MINI-ALU:
For this project, I wrote and modified verilog modules to design and test a “mini” arithmetic logic unit. An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) uses combinatorial logic to implement common arithmetic and logical functions. These functions are performed on two 6-bit inputs to produce an output.

FINITE STATE MACHINE:
For this project, I designed a system that consists of an LFSR, a sequence detecting Finite State Machine (FSM) and a counter.  The FSM counts the number of times a certain 
codeword (12 bits long) is issued in a stream of bits generated by the LFSR in a full cycle of that LFSR.

Both projects were uploaded and tested on the Basys 3 FPGA development board.
